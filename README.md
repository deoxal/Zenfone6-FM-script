Install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) and [Termux:Widget](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.widget/)

Download an icon you want to use, 96x96 works good. Then rename it to icon.png

After you run the script return to the home screen and hold your thumb where there's no icons and tap Widgets. Scroll all the way down to Termux:Widget and select Termux shortcut.

I uploaded the APKs and the icons extracted from here as well.
